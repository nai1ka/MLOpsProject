    "\n",
    "#### 1. Business terminology\n",
    "A table or paragraph contains all the business related terms to be used in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Type of performance measurement that evaluates the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. In taxi business it could be average trip duration, fleet utilization rate, customer satisfaction scores, and number of rides per day.\n",
    "* Fare: Fee paid by a passenger for use of a public transport system.\n",
    "Surge Pricing: Dynamic pricing method where prices are temporarily increased as a reaction to increased demand and mostly limited supply..\n",
    "* Fleet: A group of taxis owned or operated by a single company or organization.\n",
    "Service Area: Geographical region where a business or organization provides its services or product delivery.\n",
    "* Cab:  Type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers. The same as taxi.\n",
    "* Surge multiplier: Multiplier that is in effect in the geofence or the region in which the trip ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. ML terminology\n",
    "A table or paragraph contains all the ML related terms to be used in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature: Individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon. For instance, time, location, and weather conditions are features.\n",
    "* Regression:  Technique that is to find relationship between dependent and independent variables to predict continuous values. For example, to find a dependence between features and price.\n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: Process of evaluating, filtering, manipulating, and encoding data so that a machine learning algorithm can understand it and use the resulting output. For example, encode categorical features such as source point, destination point, etc.\n",
    "* Model Evaluation: Process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning model’s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "For example, to assess the model accuracy MSE can be used.\n",
    "* Cross-Validation: Technique that is used to train and evaluate our model on a portion of our database, before re-portioning our dataset and evaluating it on the new portions.\n",
    "* Feature Engineering: Process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of a machine-learning model.\n",
    "In our case, instead of using the day as a number it is better to convert it to the day of week feature (monday, tuesday, and so on).\n",
    "* Feature Importance: Step in building a machine learning model that involves calculating the score for all input features in a model to establish the importance of each feature in the decision-making process.\n",
    "* Normalization: Process of transforming the data into a common format, so it can be used in analytics and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "* Overfitting: ML model that matches the training data too closely, losing its ability to classify and predict new data.\n",
    "For example, if the model is too complex in comparison with the problem that it is going to solve the overrfitting might occur. The model will just remember data without learning.\n",
    "* Underfitting: ML model that is simple to capture patterns in data.\n",
    "For instance, if the model is too simple in comparison with the problem that it is going to solve the underfitting might occur. The model will not be able to learn the relationships between features and the target.\n",
    "* Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluation metric used to measure the amount of error in statistical models. It assesses the average squared difference between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "In our task we will calculate MSE between target (correct) price and predicted on.\n",
    "* Hyperparameters: Model parameters that are specified before training a model.\n"

    "## Scope of the project\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "“QuickRide” is a new taxi company in the USA. They already have service areas in small cities in America. QuickRide has a mobile application which allows clients to order a ride. Now they calculate fare price only depending on mileage and don't consider rush hours and  weather conditions and want to make their algorithm more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Business problem\n",
    "QuickRide taxi company is losing a lot of money because many users are leaving. Customers are unhappy with the prices, but the company cannot just lower them or it will go bankrupt.\n",
    "They need ML model that will predict fare prices based on time, location, and weather conditions. The price should be balanced between revenue and good customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Business objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary business goal:\n",
    "Predict taxi fare pricing based on time, location and weather conditions to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "<!-- Create a ML model that will predict fare prices based on time, location and weather conditions. This model should ensure taxi prices fairness for customers while maintaining profitability for QuickRide to reduce or stop users leaving. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Related business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do peak hours (e.g., rush hours) affect fare prices and how can the price adjust for these variations?\n",
    "* What is the impact of different weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow) on taxi fare pricing?\n",
    "* How does the distance between source and destination locations influence price of the ride?\n",
    "* How can the customer determine a fair perception of fare pricing by customers and still achieve QuickRide's desired revenue targets?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ML objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict the fare prices for taxi rides based on time of day, location (source and destination points), and weather conditions (including precipitation, temperature).\n",
    "* Conduct an analysis to determine the importance of each feature (e.g., time, location, weather conditions) in predicting fare prices. This will help refine the model by focusing on the most impactful features.\n",
    "* Implement fairness metrics for the model evaluation to ensure that predicted fares are perceived as fair by customers, balancing the need for profitability with customer satisfaction.\n",
    "* Ensure the model is scalable and can generalize well to different datasets\n"

    "#### 2. Data exploration\n",
    "- During data exploration, several interesting patterns and correlations were discovered. For example, there is a dependence of the distance of the ride and the price. As length of the trip increases, the cost of the trip increases too. Moreover, day of the week, hour, product_id, name, weather summary and source and destination points of the ride also influence the price. Surprisingly, the temperature does not affect the price of a trip significantly. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the data only contains information for two months. These finfdings demonstarate that the data has enough informative features for solvig price prediction problem. However, more data collected over different months is needed for a more precise result.\n",
